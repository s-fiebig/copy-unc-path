copy-unc-path
=============

This solution allows to copy the UNC path from the explorer.

The code is from the solution for "Copy UNC network path":  http://superuser.com/questions/244579/copy-unc-network-path-not-drive-letter-for-paths-on-mapped-drives-from-windows#answer-466009

To install:

  2. Change the path in the registry file and execute it.
